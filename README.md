PracticalMachineLearning
========================
Note this is my repo for the Coursera Decision Sciences course.

The html file needed for evaluation of this project is located here.
I have also uploaded the PML_CP_2.R file which is the raw code I used to create the project.
There is also the RMD file from which I knitted the final html copy.

Enjoy
